### Example results 

![](results/free_form_syn.png)
- Synthesis results using six different input masks on liver and kidney CT images from LiTS and KiT.
  
![](results/sample_syn.png)
- Synthesis results of three different datasets covering liver, kidney, and lung, and twelve different shapes of masks using our model and
two other methods in comparison. Cases highlighted by green boxes are cases with diverse tumor contents. Tumors in red boxes are those with richer boundary information.
